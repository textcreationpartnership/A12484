         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two kinds of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions (gentle Reader) which are in controuerſy betwixt the Catholikes and Proteſtantes; the one kind is of fact, to wit, <hi>Whether Luther was the Author, and beginner of the Protestants Church and Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whether before him it were viſible and had Pastours; whether he and the firſt Protestant Preachers were ſent to preach Protestancy, and the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e:</hi> The other kind of queſtion is of Chriſts doctrine or law: For example, <hi>whether Chriſt taught good workes do iustify, be neceſſary to ſaluation, meritorious, and
<pb facs="tcp:18174:3"/> ſuch others.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why a a queſtion of Fact is handled rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doctrin</note> At this preſent I treate not of this ſecond kind of queſtion, but only of the former and that for three cauſes. Firſt the queſtions of Doctrine are innumerable, but the queſtions of Fact, few. And many haue handled them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that moſt exactly, but theſe, few haue touched, and (for ought that I know) none of purpoſe hath hitherto written of the Authour of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and in that manner as I intend to write. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly there are few queſtions of doctrine of that nature, that all other controuerſies of faith depend vpon them; but the moſt queſtions of Fact are ſuch, as if they be well decided, al other Controuerſies of religion are at an end. Such kind of queſtion this eſpecially is, which now I handle, <hi>VVhether Luther were Author and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Protestant church and Religion</hi> For if it be made manifeſt, that he was the Author and Beginner of it, euery one will ſtraihgt ſee that it is not Chriſts Church &amp; Religion, but Luthers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> deuiſe and inuention. Thirdly in queſtions of doctrine, or law, Proteſtants want not ſome pretext of Scripture (as neither any Heretikes wanted) and therfore diuers tymes they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to debate theſe kind of Queſtions, in which (as Tertullian ſayth) <hi>they pretend Scriptures,</hi>

                  </gap>ts.</hi> But in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:18174:3"/> of Fact they are deſtitute not only of al pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Scripture, vnles it be ſome moſt vaine, but alſo of all teſtimony of men and help of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſtand only vpon their owne ſayinges, &amp; are conuinced by the teſtimonies of the whol world, and ſometyme alſo by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and therefore are brought to debate theſe kind of queſtions no more willingly, then is a theefe to his tryall. Neither do they in theſe diſputs either weary the conſtant, or catch the weake; but ſhew their owne weaknes and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes vnto all kind of men. And this is the cauſe why Miniſters are ſo loath to diſpute of the Church, becauſe the Church, being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, includeth many queſtions of fact, as of antiquity, ſucceſſion, continuance, viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, miſſion, ordination of Paſtours, and ſuch like; in which points there is little colour, or ſhew on their part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fourthly, Proteſtants exact more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult poofes in queſtions of doctrine, then they can demand in matters of Fact. For in matters of Fact, wherof the ſcripture ſpeaketh nothing, they muſt be content with teſtimonies of men, againſt whome no iuſt exception can be made, or they muſt refuſe all triall of theſe kind of queſtions. But in controuerſies of doctrine, they account thoſe only to be lawfull proofes, which are taken out of the ſcripture. Neither

                  </gap>ns mouths that they can gainſay nothing.</hi> For it is the common fault of Proteſtants, which S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin ſaith, himſelfe was guilty of, whiles he was an heretike, that <hi>they will be as certaine of all things as that ſeauen and three make ten.</hi> Nay they yield not alwayes to theſe kind of proofs; For what can be ſayd more expreſſy, more plainly, more literally, then the ſcripture ſaith, that man is iuſtified by workes, and not only by faith; that, that which our Sauiour gaue with his hands to his Apoſtles after his laſt ſupper, was his very body and bloud, and ſuch like: &amp; yet the Proteſtants yield not to theſe kind of teſtimonies, but deuiſe figures and ſhiftes to delude them. Catholiques proofes in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of doctrine are certainly Theological de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, becauſe they are clearly drawne from the proper principles of Diuinity, to wit, from cleare words of God confirmed by the tradition of the Church and vnanimous expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fathers; which kind of proofe is as great and ſtrong, as either Diuinity or law, or any Science whatſoeuer which is founded in words either doth affoard, or the nature of any law or ſcience which is grounded in words (as
<pb facs="tcp:18174:4"/> Diuinity is) can beare or affoard. And as the Philoſopher ſaith well, it were ſtarck madnes to exact any other kind of proofes of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, then the nature therof can affoard.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Eth.</hi> 1.</note> But becauſe heretiques expound what words ſoeuer as they liſt, and litle ſet by the authority of the Church or Fathers, and the vnlearned hardly perceaue what kind of proofe is a Theologicall demonſtration, &amp; ſuch as Diuinity can affoard no greater, or which is the true ſenſe of Gods word, or how great the authority of the Churh and Fathers ought to be; therefore with them, Catholiks proofs in points of doctrin, albeit in truth they be Theological demonſtrations, take litle effect Wheras on the other ſide Catholique proofes in matter of Fact, are not only Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, but alſo (that I may ſo ſpeake) Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall demonſtrations, becauſe they conſiſt of one principle which is grounded not only vpon the foundations of Diuinity, to wit the word of God together with the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church and Fathers but alſo is manifeſt by the light of reaſon: which kind of principles theſe are, <hi>That Gods Church hath alwayes him: that it is one: that it is the auncienteſt of all Churches: that it is alwayes viſible: hath alwayes Pastors,</hi> and the like: And of another principle, which may be tryed by our ſenſe and experience, as that the foreſayd properties agree neither to the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb facs="tcp:18174:5"/> nor to the Anabaptiſts, nor to any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall company. And therfore theſe kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations moue euen the moſt obſtinate heretiques, and are euident euen to the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and vnlearned perſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And hence ariſeth a fift cauſe of handling rather queſtions of Fact then of doctrin, becauſe the fruit of debating thoſe queſtions is reaped with more facility and of far more. For wheras few but diuines do themſelues perceaue the true meaning of the teſtimonyes of Scripture wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the queſtions of doctrin are debated; as the true meaning of the law, few but lawyers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And I pray God they do giue place to their own moſt frequent and moſt plaine confeſſions, and not delude them by voluntary and friuolous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; for then hope may be, that there wilbe ſome end of theſe controuerſies. At leaſt we ſhall reape this profit by this labour, that by it ſhall be manifeſt to all, that either Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants will heare no teſtimony, admit no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no not their owne, which is a moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument of a moſt deſperat cauſe; or that they ſhall be condemned by their owne verdict &amp; ſentence; or laſtly that there can be no forme of ſpeech ſo plaine, no words ſo cleare, no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſo manifeſt, which they with their faig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned figures &amp; deuiſes will not wreſt, fruſtrate,

For I haue cited none in this worke which either I haue not ſeene with myne owne eyes, and for the moſt part haue quoted not only the bookes and chapters but alſo the leaues and pages, or if I haue wanted the booke, I haue cited them out of ſome good Author. The fourth difference &amp; that of great moment is, that the Catholiques,
<pb facs="tcp:18174:11"/> whoſe teſtimonyes Proteſtants alleadge againſt is (if ſo be they were true Catholikes) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to reuoke and recall whatſoeuer they had written contrary to the catholik fayth, &amp; to ſubmit all their wordes or writings to the cenſure of the catholike Church, which to be the mind &amp; diſpoſition of all Catholiks, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelues confeſſe.

               </note> Morton: <hi>Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papist that thinkes any decree of the Pope can be contemned or broken without cryme or hereſy?</hi> Which ſith it is ſo, in vaine do they obiect any Catholikes words againſt the Catholike fayth. For either they are not contrary thereto, or if they be, they are already reuoked, recalled and diſanulled by himſelfe. But the mind and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is far otherwiſe, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect not their opinions to the iudgment of the Church, but as they thinke that ſhe may erre, ſo will they hold their opinions notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſentence to the contrary; and therfore iuſtly may we produce their teſtimonies againſt their owne Church.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The fift difference, &amp; which is much to be noted, is, that Proteſtants alleadge Catholik witneſſes in matters of doctrin, in which ſome
<pb facs="tcp:18174:12"/> tymes by reaſon of the obſcurity of the matter a man may chance to erre &amp; ſlip;<note place="margin">Auguſt. l. <hi>11.</hi> cont. Fauſt. c. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> or els in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, as were in times or places far diſtant from them, ſo that themſelues could not ſearch the truth, but belieued the reports of others. Such a queſtion is that of Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants cite no Catholike author which liued not ſome ages after that time, wherin Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> is ſayd to haue beene. Or if they produce any Catholike Author in any matter of fact, the truth wherof he might haue tried, either he is of no credit, or the matter is ſuch, as it turneth to no preiudice of the Catholike faith. But we heer produce Proteſtants in a matter of fact, &amp; ſuch a matter as they could moſt eaſily know. For what was more eaſy, then for Luther and his fellowes to try either then or euer ſince, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he firſt began, there was in the world any Proteſtant company, whether it were viſible, whether it had Paſtours, and the like? For who can thinke, that only the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant company could lye ſo cloſe hid, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all Luthers time or euer ſince, either the being, or the eſtate or condition, or place or Paſtours, or any thing at all therof could be eſpied out of ſo many Arguſes, which now in one whole age haue ſifted all corners of the world to find it out? And beſides, this is ſuch a queſtion of Fact, as vpon the deciſion therof
<pb facs="tcp:18174:12"/> an end may be made of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Catholikes and Proteſtants. For (as I ſayd before) if Luther be the Author and beginner of the Proteſtant Church, it is certaine, that it is not the Church of Chriſt, nor to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but to be forſaken &amp; dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. To which I ad now, that if Luther himſelf &amp; ſuch &amp; ſo many learned &amp; famous Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as I haue cited, do by many wayes, &amp; ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe, that Luther was the Author therof, it cannot be doubted, but that he was in truth the Author of it. For I alleadge not men of ſmall credit among Proteſtants, but ſuch as are of greateſt authority with them; nor a few, but many; nor of one nation alone, but of diuers, to wit, Germans, Italians, French, Engliſh, Scottes, Flemings and others; nor Proteſtants of one ſort or ſect, but of all three namely Lutherans, Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries and Engliſh Proteſtants. So that they could not beare falſe witneſſe in this matter either for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe they were many and learned &amp; of different countries, and moſt diligent in ſearching the matter, and the matter it ſelfe moſt eaſy; nor for want of good will towards the cauſe, becauſe they were all moſt earneſt Proteſtants. And to refuſe the teſtimonies of ſuch witneſſes in a matter of fact, in their owne time, ſo eaſy to be knowne, and ſo diligently
<pb facs="tcp:18174:13"/> ſearched of them, what other thing is it, then obſtinately to refuſe to know the truth of this matter ſo important to be knowne, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be made an end of all contentions in Religion? Wherfore let Proteſtants ſay as they pleaſe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that in queſtions of doctrine they will not depend vpon Luther, Caluin, or any one, or all their doctours together, but vpon the ſcripture alone: Neuertheles in matter of fact, wherof the ſcripture ſaith nothing, ſuch as this is (for the Scripture telleth not what was the ſtate and condition of the Proteſtant Church when Luther began, in what place it was, what Paſtours it had, who ſaw it, and the like) either they muſt confeſſe, that they refuſe all triall &amp; knowledge of ſo important a truth, or they muſt giue credit to the depoſition of ſufficient witneſſes. And if euer men were or can be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witneſſes of any matter of Fact, Luther and thoſe Proteſtants which here I produce, are ſufficient witneſſes of that which I bring them for to teſtify. And thus much touching the cauſe why I proue Luther to haue been the founder of Proteſtant Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <note place="margin">Why ſo many Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes are alleaged.</note>10. As for the reaſon why I alleadge ſo many Proteſtants, that is, that it many appeare, that it is not the priuate teſtimony of ſome one or few, but the generall conſent of them all, or
<pb facs="tcp:18174:13"/> at leaſt the common ſentence of many of them. And if I ſeeme to any Catholike ouer tedious in heaping vp ſo many teſtimonies of Proteſtants, I pray him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that I write not this book to Catholikes to confirme them in the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke faith, who I know to that end doe not need the teſtimonies of Proteſtants; but that I write it partly to Catholikes, for to furniſh them with ſtore of Proteſtants teſtimonies to ſtopp their mouthes, and to ſhew them that they are right Heretikes, that is, condemned (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) by their owne iudgement, to which end a few teſtimonies of theirs would not ſuffice. And therfore to ſuch as intend this end the multitude of teſtimonies will not be troubleſome. For who, that indeauoureth to va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſh moſt obſtinate enemies, will complain of the abundance of good ſoldiers wherof he may make choice? And if I had rehearſed only ſome few teſtimonies, and named the places where the reſt may be found, ſome would haue cauilled, as M. Iewel did againſt D. Harding, that I had cited dumbe witneſſes. Beſides, ſeing the iudgments of men are diuers, it may fall out, that what kind of teſtimonyes ſeem ſtrong &amp; forcible to ſome, others acount but weake and litle to the purpoſe; and therfore it was behofull, that there ſhould be as it were a ſtore-houſe of Proteſtants teſtimonies, that euery one might
<pb facs="tcp:18174:14"/> take what weapon he thinketh fitteſt for him, &amp; vſe it againſt them. But eſpecially I gathered theſe teſtimonies of Proteſtants for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelues, that by their owne mens iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement I might withdraw them from their errour. And therfore I was not ſo fearfull to bring too many for Catholikes, as carefull to prouide inough for Proteſtants. In which I could hardly offend by multitude. For as S.<note n="(p)" place="margin">

And finally, that ſhe is no true Church, who willfully maintaineth any one thing repugnant to the Ghoſpell or word of God.

               <p n="7">7. By all, which hath byn rehearſed in this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18174:25"/> chapter out of Proteſtants, it appeareth how many ſortes of Chriſtians, Proteſtants do ſometymes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude out of the Church, namely Papiſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Arians, al Heretiks, all Schiſmatiks, all thoſe, who deny any fundamentall point of fayth, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally al who obſtinatly deny any point whatſoeuer of fayth, or of the word of God. And how many things they ſometymes require to the making and being of a Proteſtant, to wit, that he belieue all and euery point of their fayth, and obſtinatly diſſent in none. To which their doctrine, if they would (as I haue ſayd) alwayes conſtantly ſtand, it would eaſily appeare, firſt how ſmall a company the Proteſtants Church is, and how little it is ſpread through the world, and much leſſe Catholike or vniuerſal, ſeeing there is no Prouince, nor ſcarſe any citty, in which all Proteſtants agree amongſt themſelues in al points of their doctrine. Secondly it would eaſily appeare that the Proteſtant Church was neuer before <hi>Luther,</hi> ſeeing there is no apparence, that before him there was any company of Chriſtians who in all points of doctrine agreed with Proteſtants. But Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (as I ſayd in the Preface) accommodate their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and opinions to tymes and occaſions. And the tymes, when they deny Papiſts to be of the Church, are when they exhort them to leaue the Roman Church, or excuſe their owne reuolting from her, or when they dehort others from returning to her. For at all theſe tymes, it ſerueth to their purpoſe to deny that Papiſts are of the Church, or in the way of ſaluation; which at other tymes, as we ſhall ſee in the next chapter, they are content to graunt. And the tymes when they exclude Anabaptiſts, Arians, Heretiks, Schiſmatiks, and all that deny either fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18174:25"/> or other articles of fayth, out of the Church, are, when either the euidence of truth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth them thereto, or when they are aſhamed to acknowledge ſuch vgly monſters for brethren and members of their Church, or would exhort ſuch as haue left their company to returne vnto them, and keep others from forſaking them: or finally would brag of the agreement and purity in doctrine of their company. For at thoſe tymes it ſerueth their turne to renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all the foreſayd kind of men, whom at other tymes, eſpecially when we demaund of them, who were of their Church before Luther, they are moſt willing to receiue, as their kind bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; diligently ſcraping &amp; gathering ſuch ſhreeds and clouts, when they perceiue their owne nakednes and beggary, which themſelues, when they thought they were rich and had no need thereof, moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully caſt on the dunghills, as ſhall appeare in the chapters following.</p>

Seing therefore by the confeſſion of Proteſtants, he was both an earneſt Papiſt vnto his dying day, for all his life tyme he honoured maſſe, beleiued the Popes ſuperiority (in which two points Proteſtants ſay the eſſence and ſoule of a Papiſt doth conſiſt) and briefly belieued all things belonging to the Pope to come from God: and alſo was a very holy man, in his life tyme, and now a bleſſed Saint in heauen; they muſt needs confeſſe, that euen the moſt veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Papiſt may be of the church; becauſe neither true ſanctity, nor ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be found out of the church.

And their deeds and actions do no leſſe declare their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and eſteeme of the miſſion and Paſtorall charge which is in the church of Rome.

And in artic. 10.

And euen to this day, if any renegate Prieſt ioyne himſelfe to the Proteſtants, they order him not anew, but deeme him fit for their miniſteriall function, by vertue of the orders he receiued of Papiſts.

Perkins de Sacramento Baptiſmi tom. 1. col. 846: <hi>Others ſay, that the fayth of the Parents is alſo the fayth of their children, all the tyme of their infancy or childhood, and that becauſe parents do by their fayth apprehend the promiſe both for themſelues and for their children: VVhich opinion ſeemeeh to me the fitteſt of all.</hi> The like he ſayth in cap. 3. Galat. The ſequele like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18174:33"/> is vndoubted. For if the fayth of Popiſh parents be of force to eſtabliſh their very children in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of God and eſtate of ſaluation, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide not in them, nor be their act; much more doth it eſtabliſh the parents themſelues, who haue that fayth in them, and whoſe act it is. Nor do the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances D. Morton brings againſt it in his anſwere to the Proteſtants Apology, lib. 4. cap. 6. make any thing to the purpoſe; as that in caſe of neceſſity an hereticall Prieſt or Schiſmatike may abſolue from ſinnes; and an Infidell adminiſter Baptiſme. Againe: That if ſuch as were free of a citty and are araigned of treaſon, ſhould haue iſſue after their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their children neuertheles ſhall enioy the title and right of cittizens, whereof their parents were deſtitute. Theſe examples (I ſay) are not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; becauſe he, who is eyther baptized by an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, or abſolued by an hereticall Prieſt, enters not into the couenant of God and eſtate of ſaluation for ought that is in the perſon which baptizeth or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth him, but for the Sacrament of Baptiſme or Pennance, which he receiueth indeed by the others adminiſtration, but hath it in himſelfe. And the ſonne of a traytor is not made a Cittizen, in regard of any thing that is in the father alone, but for his owne birth which appertaines to himſelfe, though his Father be author thereof. But the Sacramentaries teach, that the child of a Papiſt is in the couenant of God and eſtate of ſaluation, not for his owne fayth (for they ſay he hath none) but for the beliefe of his father; which is no way poſſible, if the ſame fayth be not of force to worke the like effect in the father himſelfe; ſeeing it belongs farre more to him, then to his child, and therefore muſt ſooner giue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18174:33"/> in the couenant, then the child that is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him. For how can the fathers beliefe lay hold on the promiſes and couenant of God for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and cannot do it for himſelfe?</p>

Of which kind of men I deny not but there haue byn alwayes ſome rable, but none but a mad man will ſay, that it was the holy Church &amp; ſpouſe of Chriſt. Sixtly we ſee how litle Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts account <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of their Church, fayth, and religion; and belieue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then that it is the church of God, or fayth of Chriſt. For who doubteth, but Schiſme, hereſy, infidelity, Atheiſme, are moſt peſtilent plagues and infernall darkneſſe directly oppoſite to eccleſiaſticall Communion and fayth, which are the forme, life, &amp; ſoule of the Church? And who can imagin,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that he can aſſociate and vnite together formes ſo contrary as are light and darkneſſe, life and death, truth and lies? or that the ſociety in darkneſſe, lies, and death, as are the ſocieties in Schiſme, Hereſy, and infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can become one with the ſociety in light, life, &amp; truth, as the Church is?

               <head>That it is neceſſary for a Proteſtant to belieue with only ſpeciall fayth that himſelfe is iuſtified. <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. ABOVE all things it is moſt neceſſary to an inuiſible or true Proteſtant in the ſight of God (as they terme him) that with only ſpeciall or peculiar fayth he belieue ſome thing belonging to himſelfe, to wit, that he is iuſtified in Chriſt, or (as they vſe to ſpeake) that with fayth he apprehend Chriſts iuſtice, and apply it vnto him elf in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And to a viſible Proteſtant in ſight of men it is in like ſort neceſſary, that he profeſſe himſelf to belieue with ſuch a fayth that he is iuſtified in Chriſt. For example; For Luther to haue byn a true Proteſtant before God, it is needfull that he haue truly belieued himſelfe to be iuſtified by only the foreſayd ſpeciall fayth, which he had of his own iuſtice; which faith they call ſpeciall or particuler, becauſe it was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer to Luther, no man being bound to belieue Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be iuſtified beſides himſelfe. And for Luther to haue byn a viſible Proteſtant in the ſight of men, it was needful in like manner to haue profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to haue belieued that he was iuſtified by only the ſayd fayth. The ſame I ſay of Caluin and of euery Proteſtant in particuler. That according to their doctrine it is moſt neceſſary to a Proteſtant that he belieue himſelfe to be iuſtified by only ſpeciall fayth is manifeſt. Firſt becauſe they teach, that a man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by only ſpeciall fayth, wherwith he belieueth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18174:58"/> ſomething belonging to himſelfe alone, not by an vniuerſall or Catholike fayth whereby he belieueth the myſteryes of Chriſtian religion common to all, and which euery one muſt belieue, for this fayth they call hiſtoricall, and ſay it may be in ſuch as are not iuſt, yea in hipocrites and Deuills. Seing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their opinion no man is a true Proteſtant in the ſight of God, but only he that is iuſt, nor any iuſt but who hath a ſpeciall or peculiar fayth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he apprehendeth Chriſts iuſtice to himſelfe, it is manifeſt, that according to their principles, none can be a true Proteſtant before God, vnleſſe he haue the foreſayd ſpeciall fayth; and in like manner that none can be a viſible Proteſtant before men, vnleſſe he profeſſe to belieue iuſtification by only ſpeciall fayth; becauſe none can be accounted to be of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vnleſſe he profeſſe to belieue thoſe meanes of obtayning iuſtification and remiſſion of ſins, which that religion teacheth.

Finally, Proteſtants are wont to laugh at Catholiks if they proue any Father to haue byn a Papiſt, becauſe he held ſome fundamentall point of Papiſtry. For thus writeth Pareus lib. 1. de amiſſ. gratiae cap. 1: <hi>It is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for him to conclude S.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18174:62"/> that we are Papists, becauſe we agree with Papiſts in ſome truth.</hi> And D.

I adde alſo, that againſt Proteſtants we do rightly conclude, that the holy Fathers were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, if we do ſhew that they diſſented from Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in one or more fundamentall points. For they will not deny, but that the Fathers were either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or Proteſtants: But Proteſtants they were not, if they denyed their doctrine in any fundamentall point thereof: therfore they muſt needs be Papiſts. And the like is not of others, whome Proteſtants cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude to haue byn theirs, if they can proue that they were none of ours.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18174:67"/> and religion, and regard not whither that before his tyme there were any, who were Proteſtants only in part and in ſome ſort, and held only ſome part of Proteſtant religion, but not the whole ſubſtance thereof. And hereupon we frame an inuincible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to proue that there was no true Proteſtant or Proteſtant church before Luther.<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a true Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> Euery true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant belieueth Iuſtification by only ſpeciall faith, and at leaſt virtually and implicitly belieueth the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Confeſsion of Auſpurg, or of Saxony, Scotland, Strasburg, or Bohemia. But there was no man, no Church before Luther who thus belieued. Therefore no true Proteſtant or Proteſtant church. The Maior is the very definition of a true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, gathered partly out of the common doctrine of all Proteſtants, partly out of the foreſayd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions of their fayth. The Minor being negatiue is ſufficiently manifeſt, by that neither Luther, nor any in his tyme, or to this day could produce any one man or company who before Luthers preaching had belieued in that ſort. This foundation therefore touching the eſſence and ſubſtance of a Proteſtant and Proteſtant Church being layd, to wit, that he only is a true abſolute Proteſtant, who belieueth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by only ſpeciall fayth, and the foreſayd other fundamentall points of Proteſtancy, and that the Proteſtant Church is a company of ſuch belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and the Proteſtant religion ſuch a beliefe and worſhip of God; I will endeauour in this next book out of Proteſtants teſtimonies and Confeſsions to proue, that Luther was the firſt beginner of their Church and Religion.</p>

ALBEIT the foreſayd confeſſions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants touching the ſubſtantiall decay of their Church and religion before Luther aroſe, be ſo plaine and euident, as we may well ſay with Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian: <hi>VVho will not acknowledge theſe rather then expound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Their firſt ſhift is,<note place="margin">Their firſt ſhift.</note> that the forenamed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by the words of <hi>fayth, religion,</hi> and the like, when they ſay that they periſhed, did not meane the inward fayth of the heart, as if no man in his heart had held the Proteſtant fayth or religion, but only the outward profeſſion thereof, and ſo meane only, that the outward profeſſion of Proteſtancy was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, or that none profeſſed it. I graunt indeed, that ſomtyme they ſpeake of outward profeſſion of faith, but this commeth all to one purpoſe.<note place="margin">That they ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward faith periſhed.</note> Becauſe the profeſſion of faith can no more periſh in the church, then the fayth it ſelfe, as hereafter we ſhall proue by the confeſſions of Proteſtants themſelues.

Firſt, becauſe they ſay ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all proofe, neither can they proue it otherwiſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18174:77"/> then becauſe perhaps the ſame Proteſtants haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where ſayd the contrary, which kind of proofe we hereafter ſhew to be nothing worth.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. vl.</note> Againe it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> credible, vnleſſe one will belieue what he liſt, that by ſo many words of <hi>light, clarity, religion, worship of God, truth of God,</hi>

Beſides, they ſayd plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That none belieued to be iustified without workes. That the doctrine of Iuſtification by ſayth, was blotted out of the memory of men,</hi>

                  <hi>that holeſome truth perished from earth, and that it was taken from men, that Christ was buryed and taken out of the world and the Church, that all</hi> (Proteſtant) <hi>conſolation was vnknowne, that without Luther one iot had not byn knowne, that the knowledge of Chriſt, the knowledge of ſayth, fayled, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Chriſt was not vnderſtood but vtterly vnknowne.</hi> Which words are manifeſtly ſpoken &amp; meant of true or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fayth. I adde alſo, that it is a rule of ciuil law approued by Luther and Proteſtants,<note place="margin">Luther de abrog miſ. &amp; epiſt, ad Amsd. Schuſſelb. tom. <hi>4.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. haeret.</note> that who cold ſpeak clearely, and yet ſpake obſcurely, ſhould haue his words expounded againſt him. Seeing therefore Proteſtants could haue ſpoken farre more clearly, if they had meant only that outward profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith had periſhed, we may lawfully expound their words againſt themſelues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To this ſhift is another like, wherewith they ſay that the foreſayd teſtimonies of Proteſtants touching the deſtruction or decay of their Church are not to be vnderſtood of their inuiſible Church,<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſhift.</note> which they ſay is the company of only true fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and predeſtinate men, but of the decay of their viſible Church, which they ſay is the company of al thoſe that profeſſe true doctrine, and is the Church
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18174:77"/> not in the ſight of God, but only in the eyes of men. I do not deny, that ſometymes they ſpeake of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, notwithſtanding (as before I ſayd) it comes all to one purpoſe, becauſe (as ſhall be proued hereafter) there can be no inuiſible Church without a viſible, nor a company of faythfull and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate men, but they muſt profeſſe their fayth.<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſay the true Church hath peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> But moſt falſe it is, that they ſpeake not alſo of the true Church, which they will haue to be inuiſible to any but to God alone. For firſt (as before I argued) this cannot be proued otherwiſe, then that perhaps the ſame men haue at other tymes ſayd the contrary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which will proue, that they like lyers haue contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themſelues, not, that they haue not ſayd this, which they haue as clearly ſayd, as euer they ſayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe. Beſides, in ſaying (according to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> meaning) that the Church hath not periſhed or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh, they do not indeed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict themſelues, when they ſay that it hath or can periſh.

                  <hi>Hence he gathereth, not as our aduerſaries do, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church shall neuer ſaile, but that ſayth shall neuer ſaile in the whole, but that to the end of the world Chriſtian religion shal remayne in ſome. This</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is the very thing which we ſay &amp; maintaine.</hi> Ye ſee plainly, that when they ſay the church cannot faile, they only meane that fayth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notvtterly faile, but that it ſhall be alwayes in ſome. Wherein there is no contradiction to that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they teach, that the Church can faile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fayth and the Church are different things; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth fayth in whome ſoeuer, and in how few ſoeuer, make the Church. Wherefore if they be mad men and no Chriſtians, who ſay that the Catholike Church may faile, or that the Church is not to dure for euer (as D. Whitaker himſelfe ſayth cap. 1. &amp; 2. cit.) certainly theſe Proteſtants are ſuch. For whiles they ſay, that the Church may be brought to one or two, and that all Paſtors may periſh; they manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay indeed and effect, that both the Catholike and all kind of true Churches may faile. Moreouer I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> proue, that they meane that the true Church was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18174:78"/> periſhed, becauſe they think that ſhe is made by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fayth; but this they affirme to haue periſhed, as euen now appeared. Beſides, the very name of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Church properly ſignifieth the true Church, and only improperly that which is not the true Church. And therefore when it is ſimply and abſolutely put, it ought to be taken for the true Church; which thing alſo themſelues do teach. For thus writeth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deel in Refutat. Theſ. Poſnan. cap. 4. pag. 827: <hi>VVhen the Church is ſimply put, or when it is ſayd the Church of Chriſt, it properly ſignifieth only the elect.</hi> Hereupon alſo Kemnice in loc. tit. de Eccleſ. cap. 3. defineth the Church <hi>to be the Catholike company.</hi> But the Catholike company is the true Church, as is euident by the Creed, where we profeſſe to belieue the Catholike Church, and is confeſſed by D.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 8.</note> Finally becauſe they ſay, that Elias thought that there was not remayning one pious man beſides himſelfe, that he was the only Chriſtian, the only true worſhipper of God, which was left aliue, and actuall member of the true Church. Seing therfore they will make Elias to thinke ſo of the true church, of the ſame alſo ought themſelues to be vnderſtood, who vſe to draw arguments out of Elias his words; eſpecially when as they ſay, that it ſufficeth if there be one or two faythfull men in the moſt forlorne tymes of the Church, which they muſt needs meane of the true Church which they will haue to conſiſt only of the faythfull ſeruants of God.</p>

                  <note place="margin">That they meane of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church.</note>4. Their third ſhift may be, that when they ſpeake of the deſtruction of the Church, they meane not of the vniuerſall or whole Church, but of ſome particuler, or part of the Church. But this is eaſily refuted. Firſt becauſe (as we haue rehearſed) they ſay <hi>there was a ſlaughter of the whole Church, that all the Church was corrupted, all became idolatrous, that ſcarce the name of Chriſtianity was left, that none belieued, that not one iot of the ghoſpell had byn knowne without Luther, that the whole know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, all pure worship, all true religion was abolished.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly becauſe vnder the name of Elias they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18174:79"/> ſay, that <hi>the whole Church was extinct, the whole Church failed, he alone was a faythfull man,</hi>

                  <hi>and actuall member of the true Church.</hi> Wherefore either they thinke it not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to ſay the whole Church hath periſhed, or this horrible blaſphemy which calleth in queſtion all religion, they moſt impiouſly attribute to that holy Prophet. Thirdly, becauſe they ſay that their Church <hi>was brought to one or two, and that it is inough to the Church, if there be one or two faythfull perſons.</hi> But what man well in his wittes will ſay, that one or two are inough to make the Catholike or vniuerſall church. Finally, this ſhall yet more appeare out of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following, where we ſhall ſee, that they teach that the whole world did fall from the fayth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their fourth ſhift is,<note place="margin">That they meane of a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing.</note> that by the words <hi>Destruction, decaying, failing, ouerthrowing,</hi> and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they meane not a ſubſtantiall periſhing of the fayth or Church, but only an accidentall corruption of becomming worſe. But this ſhift alſo is ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. Firſt becauſe Luther ſayth of his fayth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or ghoſpell, that it <hi>dyed, was neglected, ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, extinct, blotted out, taken away, ouerthrowne, loſt,</hi>

Of the Church alſo they ſay, that it <hi>was banished fayled, was oppreſſed, extinct, ouerturned, fallen, wholy fallen, that it fell to Antichriſt, that the old foundation thereof was remoued, and a new layd, that the order of the Church pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, that there was a ſlaughter of the whole Church, that Chriſts Kingdome was throwne downe &amp; razed to the ground,

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18174:81"/> were others that were of the Church beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to wit Adam and Eue.

Eyther therefore their Church and fayth is not the true but falſe, or elſe they meane of their owne.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18174:86"/> ſpeaches of the ſcripture, and thoſe ſpoken of other matters, rather then according to their own plaine and manifeſt ſignification. Who made this law of expounding Proteſtants words? Or do they keep it in expounding Catholiks or other mens wordes? God may ſpeake in ſcripture as he thinkes beſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ought according to cuſtome, (which as is ſayd is the law and rule of ſpeach) both to ſpeak and to be vnderſtood.

I anſweare, that Saint Hieromes example doth nothing auaile Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Firſt becauſe Saint Hierome ſayd once ſo, Proteſtants very often. Againe, he ſayd ſo only in heat of diſpute with his aduerſary; Proteſtants haue written ſo when they diſputed with none. Beſides, Saint Hierome in the very ſame place expoundeth himſelfe, that he meant not that indeed the whole world was become Arian: For he ſayth, that it <hi>was euident that the Bishops vvere no Arians, but belieued a right and abode in the agreement of fayth,</hi> but only ſpeaketh ſo becauſe all the Biſhops aſſembled at Arimini yelded to the Arians, that the word Conſubſtantiall ſhould not be vſed. But Proteſtants ſay not that all the world yelded to the Pope about the ſuppreſſing of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18174:86"/> one only word, but that all from the firſt to the laſt, from the top to the toe were drowned in Popiſh errours, and none belieued or ſo much as dreamed of that which is moſt fundamentall and neceſſary in Proteſtant religion: Which kind of ſpeaches S. Hierome neuer vſed. Againe, Saint Hierome vſed only this phraſe: <hi>The whole world,</hi> but Proteſtants vſe both that and many more and more plaine. Laſtly albeit Saint Hierome had ſpoken altogether as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do, yet there were no reaſon that they ſhould be vnderſtood rather according to Saint Hieromes meaning, then according to their owne moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, moſt plaine, and moſt frequent words, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when as Luther ſayth tom. 1. fol. 414: <hi>Many thinges are borne withall in the Fathers, who were knowne to be ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, which we may not imitate.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THE fourth demonſtration, wherewith we will proue Luther to haue byn the Author of the Proteſtant church and religion we will draw out of that which they confeſſe of the inuiſibility thereof before Luther brake out. And by the way I muſt aduertiſe the Reader of two things. The one is, that by the name of the Church is not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only the men who are of the Church, but their ſociety in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby they make a church. wherefore thoſe Proteſtants ſpeake not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who to excuſe the abſurdity of their doctrine touching the inuiſibility of the Church, ſay they meane not, that the men, whereof it conſiſted, were inuiſible men; for it ſufficeth, that they confeſſe, that they were inuiſible worſhippers of God, according to the Proteſtant manner; or that their ſociety in this kind of worſhip of God was inuiſible.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The other point is, that in theſe kind of queſtions: <hi>VVhether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther the Proteſtant Church were?

                  <hi>VVhither it had Paſtors?</hi> and the like: the Catholiks hold the negatiue part, and Proteſtants the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and that it belongeth to the affirmer, to proue what he affirmeth: wherein if he faile, he is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: and it is not needfull for the denyer to proue his denyall, but is ſufficient reaſonably to anſwere the proofes of the affirmer: which if he performe, he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18174:87"/> hath wonne the cauſe. As if one like Anaxagoras would ſay, that there were many worlds beſides this: or that ſuch and ſuch things haue byn done in tymes paſt; he were bound to proue what he ſayth, &amp; he that ſhould deny ſuch matters, were not bound to proue his denyall, but only reaſonably to anſwere his aduerſaries arguments. And the reaſon is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, becauſe for to affirme or belieue any thinge, we muſt haue reaſon or proofe thereof: bur for the not belieuing of it, we need no other reaſon, then to ſhew that there is no ſufficient reaſon why it ſhould be belieued. Hereupon Luther in his booke againſt Henry 8. King of England tom. 2. fol. 340 ſayd: <hi>He must be taught the principles of diſputation, who hauing to proue his affirmation, vrgeth his aduerſary to proue his denyall.</hi> And Vorſtins in his Antibellarm. pag. 464: <hi>It is inough for the denyer, probably to deny.</hi> Wherefore in theſe kind of queſtions Proteſtants ought to be vrged to performe their part, that is, to proue what they affirme, to wit, that before Luthers tyme their Church was, had Paſtors, and the like: which if they cannot do, they muſt needs confeſſe, that in this debate they haue loſt their cauſe. And they ought not to preſſe vs to proue, that before Luther their Church was not, had not Paſtors &amp;c. Becauſe (as I ſayd) herein we are only the defenders and denyers,<note place="margin">

For as we haue heard, they oftentymes profeſſe openly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Vntruly alſo D.

But this, is not the church to haue byn viſible, but the men to haue byn viſible. Beſides that, it is inough for vs, that the Proteſtant Religion and manner of worſhipping God was before Luthers tyme altogeather inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and only ſecret in the hearts of ſome few. For thence it will follow, (as ſhall appeare hereafter) that it is not the religion of God, which can neuer be kept ſo ſecret and inuiſible.

Laſtly ſome do vntruly expound the foreſayd words
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18174:96"/> of Proteſtants, as if they had only ſayd, that their Church had byn inuiſible in ſome ſort, not ſimply and abſolutely; becauſe their words were moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute: and it is ſophiſticall to expound ſo many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſpeeches, only in ſome ſort: Beſides, hereafter we ſhall ſee, that ſometymes they confeſſe, that their church was ſo inuiſible, as it implyed contradiction to haue it ſeene, and thoſe who limitate the former ſpeaches, agree not togeather in their expoſitions; For D.

               <p n="14">14.<note place="margin">Luther Author of the viſible Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church.</note> Of all things which haue byn related in this Chapter, it is moſt cleare, that Luther was at leaſt author of the Proteſtants viſible Church, and if not the firſt which founded it, yet the firſt which after it was fallen &amp; in ſubſtance periſhed, did rayſe and reſtore it againe. For when Luther began firſt to preach, there was no viſible Proteſtant Church at all, and by his preaching there became ſuch a viſible Church. Therefore vndoubtedly he was the author thereof. And if any Proteſtant againſt ſo many and ſo open Confeſſions of his Fathers and brethren, will ſay that there was a viſible Proteſtant Church before Luther, he ſhall firſt gaineſay ſo many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes without all exception in this matter, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſearched all corners, and enquired of all men
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18174:98"/> haue neuertheleſſe confeſſed, that at that tyme no ſuch viſible Church appeared. Beſides, he ſhall ſay that, without all either diuine or humane teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which to do of tymes before his age, is to play the Prophet, or rather the mad man. For it is not the part of a man in his wittes, to affirme without all kind of teſtimony, eſpecially ſuch a thing and ſo manifeſtly falſe, as that ſo many, and ſuch kind of men, as had moſt need to affirme it, were neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe forced to deny it. That it wanteth all ſufficient humane teſtimony is euident, becauſe neither the foreſayd Proteſtants, nor any yet to this day, could bring forth any ſufficient witneſſe, who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he had ſeene ſuch a Church before Luthers reuolt. That alſo it is deſtitute of diuine teſtimony, is manifeſt by what hath byn before rehearſed. For Proteſtants (at we haue heard) teach, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of perpetuity, which in the ſcripture are made to the church,<note place="margin">Sup. num. 7.</note> are made only to the inuiſible church, that is to a ſociety of men in election and Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of which Church they exclude the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and wicked; and not to the viſible Church, that is, to the ſociety in Profeſſion of true doctrine and lawfull vſe of Sacraments. And in truth they moſt needs ſay ſo, ſith they commonly teach, that the inuiſible Church, whereof the elect and iuſt alone are members, is the true Church before God: and that the viſible Church, whereof the wicked &amp; reprobate may be members, is but a Church in ſight of men, that is a ſhadow and outward ſhew of the Church. And it is cleare, that God promiſed perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity to that Church only, which in his ſight is the true Church; and not to her which is no Church, but only in ſight of men. When as I ſay they teach
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18174:98"/> that God promiſed perpetuity and continuance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the inuiſible Church, out of his promiſes they cannot inferre,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Maxim. c. <hi>3.</hi> l <hi>3</hi> c <hi>176</hi>

                  </note> that it is moſt abſurd, to ſay in Elias his tyme there was any Church viſible amongſt the Gentiles beſide the Synagogue, which now after ſo many thouſands of years we cannot name; how much more abſurd ought they think it, to ſay that before Luther aroſe, there was a viſible Proteſtant Church, which yet none neither of that Church, nor out of it, neither at this tyme, nor at that, could euer name?</p>
               <p n="15">15. It being thus manifeſt, that Luther was the Author of the viſible Proteſtant Church, it followeth likewiſe that he was the author of all and Euery Proteſtant Church. For (as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter) there can be no ſuch inuiſible Church as Proteſtants meane, that is, ſuch as belieueth and worſhippeth God only in hart and mind, and no way profeſſeth outwardly her fayth and religion. Yet before we come to that, we will firſt refute thoſe, who when they conſider how abſurd a thing it is to affirme ſuch an inuiſible Church, eſpecially for ſo many ages, they begin to ſhufle and either ſend vs to others, or themſelues name vs ſuch, as only in part or in ſome ſort held Proteſtantiſme, but imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not all the ſubſtantiall points thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were but halfe Proteſtants.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18174:100"/> againſt them at thoſe tymes. And Illyricus in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of witneſſes printed at Geneua 1597. lib. 15. pag. 544. writeth their opinions out of an ancient Catholique writer, and pag. 559. out of Aenaeas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius, and pag. 539. relateth their Confeſſion out of Sleidan, and himſelfe pag. 536. reckoneth 13. of their articles, of which he hath theſe words: <hi>Theſe are the articles of the VValdenſes, albeit others part them into more bran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, and make them more.</hi> But in none of them is there any trace of only iuſtifying fayth. The ſame I ſay of their Confeſſion which the ſayd Illyricus hath in his Catalogue printed at Geneua 1526. yea there col. 1832. he ſayth, that Huſſe and Hierome of Prage did add vnto the doctrine of the Waldenſes the article of free iuſtification by only fayth, as (ſayth he) Syluius intimateth: wherein albeit he belye both Huſſe and Hierome &amp; alſo Syluius,<note place="margin">

Moreouer Luther (as we ſhall now rehearſe) confeſſeth that the Waldenſes knew nothing of his imputatiue iuſtice by only fayth: How then can they be ſayd to haue byn true and abſolute Proteſtants, who wanted the very ſoul, ſumme, and definition of a Proteſtant? Secondly they not only belieued not iuſtification by only fayth, but belieued the contrary; that is, to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by good works. For thus ſayth Luther of them in his table-talkes chap. of Suermers: <hi>The VValdenſes are holy workmen and belieue not that ſayth without works doth iuſtify, and know nothing at all of imputatiue iuſtice.</hi>

And likwiſe out of Aeneas Syluius, that they ſayd it was lawfull for euery one to preach; &amp; that he who was guilty of mortall ſinne, was not not capable of any ſecular or eccleſiaſticall dignity.

Moreouer Illyricus in his Catalogue in fol. col. 1502. writeth, that after <hi>Luther was knowne, the VValdenſes did greedily purchaſe greater knowledge.</hi> Morgenſtern in his foreſayd booke pag. 79. ſayth, that <hi>they borrow the best part of their doctrine from the Lutherans.</hi> And D.

Againe Iurgenicius in the 2. chap. of his warre of the 5. ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, affirmeth that the Authors of the Bohemian Confeſſion do profeſſe in the beginning thereof, that they would neuer conioyne themſelues to the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes; and therefore the Bohemian Confeſſion is not the Waldenſes Confeſſion. Nor albeit therein be mention of iuſtification by only fayth, can it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that therefore the Waldenſes did belieue it. Finally (as I haue often ſayd and it muſt be alwayes inculcated) I regard not, whome any one ſayth to haue byn Proteſtants, but whom he proueth to haue byn ſuch. Neither whome he can proue to haue byn Proteſtants in part and in ſome ſort; but whome he can proue to haue byn abſolutely and wholy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, at leaſt for the ſubſtance of Proteſtancy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it auaile any whit, to complaine, that we

For if they haue nor wherwithall to proue they were true Proteſtants, they in vaine do feigne it. Beſides, we asked of Luther &amp; his followers to produce one man, Waldenſian or other, who had byn a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, before Luthers preaching; for which end there was no need of writings, but of liuing men.</p>

Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Wiclifiſts are reckoned amongſt Heretiks of many Proteſtants, as of Schuſſelburg tom. 3.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18174:108"/> life, of the Church militant, of the Church which is belieued, of the proper Church, of the Church whereof the Scripture properly ſpeaketh, when it calleth her the ſpouſe of Chriſt, the body of Chriſt; of the true Church, of the Church properly ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and finally of the Catholike Church; that (I ſay, it is of the definition and eſſence, a marke of this church, to be a viſible company profeſſing the faith, partaking the Sacraments, mutually confirming themſelues, and that otherwiſe it is (as they ſay) but a carcaſſe of the Church. Wherefore it implieth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradiction, that there ſhould at any tyme haue byn a true Church, and not a viſible company: becauſe nothing can be without all its eſſentiall parts. The Proteſtant Church therefore, which (as we head) was before Luthers tyme altogeather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, was no true and proper Church, but (to vſe their termes) a Platonicall idaea, or a carkaſſe of a Church. If any reply, that when Proteſtants affirme the foreſayd definitions, properties, and marks of the true Church; they meane not by the name of the true Church that which is ſimply and abſolutely the true Church, but that which is the true viſible Church; I aske, why then do they ſimply call it the true Church, if they do not ſo meane? why are not their words conformable to their meaning? Beſides, the Church wherof they giue the foreſayd definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and marks, they call not only the true Church, but alſo the Church properly ſo termed, the ſpouſe and body of Chriſt, the Catholike church, and ſuch like, which cannot agree to any, which is but a Church in appearance only, and in the ſight of men, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that which is the Church in very deed, and in the ſight of God. Further more, according to the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18174:108"/> opinion of Proteſtants theſe two termes <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> in the nature of the Church do one deſtroy the other; as theſe two, <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Painted,</hi> exclude each other in the nature of a man. For they imagine that the true Church is a ſociety in ſomething that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, to wit in iuſtification and predeſtination. Wherupon they deny any ill or reprobate Chriſtians to be of the true Church. Wherefore, as he ſhould ſpeake fondly, who ſhould ſay <hi>A true painted man;</hi> ſo, according to their owne opinion, they ſpeake as fondly, when they ſay <hi>The true viſible Church.</hi> But as we can only ſay, the true picture of a man, attributing the word <hi>True,</hi> to the picture, not to the man; ſo they ſhould only, <hi>The true appearance or shew of the Church,</hi> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the word <hi>True</hi> to the ſhew, not to the Church it ſelfe. But they are aſhamed to ſpeak ſo, leaſt when they inquire the marks of the true viſible Church,<note place="margin">Why Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſomtyme call the viſible viſible Church the true Church.</note> it ſhould appeare, that they ſeeke not the marks of the true Church indeed, but only of the ſhew, ſhadow, or ſhape of the Church. And yet in very truth they ſeeke but the marks of the ſhadow of the church. For the inuiſible Church, conſiſting only of the iuſt and elect, which alone they will haue to be the true Church; hath no certaine marks; elſe we ſhould know certainly who were the iuſt and elect.

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:18174:109"/>4. If any againe reply, that when Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſay, <hi>The true viſible Church,</hi> they meane the viſible Church true in doctrine, in which ſpeach there is no contradiction according to their owne opinion, becauſe they admit, that the viſible Church, (that is, the ſociety in true doctrine and right vſe of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into which Church or ſociety the wicked or reprobate may enter,) may be true in doctrine, though they graunt not, that ſuch a Church or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety be the true Church in nature or eſſence. Which perhaps Vorſtius meant, in his Antibellarm. pa. 180. when he ſayd: <hi>The outward Church is not without cauſe called the true church of Chriſt by reaſon of the proſeſsion of true doctrine.</hi> I anſwere, if they ſo meant, why did they not ſpeak ſo? were they ignorant, that it is one thing to be true in doctrine or in ſpeach, and another to be true in nature? as a lyer is a true man in nature of man, but not true in his ſpeach. Or if they did know this, why did they abuſe the words and their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers? Moreouer, though in this ſenſe their words did not deſtroy themſelues, as they did in the former, yet fondly ſhould they (as they vſe to do) aſſigne the truth of doctrine for the marke of the true Church in doctrine. For this were to aſſigne a thing for a mark of it ſelf; as if to know a true man of his word, one ſhould giue this marke, that it is ſuch as ſpeaketh truth. Beſides this were rather to define what is a true man, then to giue the marke to know who is a true man. And yet marks are giuen to know which is the true Church, not what is the nature of the true Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If yet any reply, that the viſible Church or ſociety in profeſſion of true doctrine and right vſe of Sacraments, is termed of Proteſtants the true
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18174:109"/> Church, not becauſe this Church or ſociety is of it ſelf the true church or the ſociety inſtituted by God, but becauſe alwayes in, or vnder it there is the true Church, to wit the ſociety in iuſtice and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; by reaſon that in euery company of them that profeſſe true doctrine and rightly vſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there are ſome, who are ſociated and vnited in iuſtice and predeſtination. Which D. Whitaker intimateth, when Cont. 2. queſt. 4. cap. 1 pag. 485. he ſayth: <hi>The viſible Church, which holdeth and profeſſeth true ſayth, is the true Church only of the part of the elect and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated:</hi> I anſwere, that this ſuppoſeth a thing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and perhaps falſe. For what certainty can there be, that in euery particuler company of them who profeſſe the true fayth &amp; rightly vſe the Sacraments, there is alwayes a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the iuſt and elect; when as Chriſt ſayth: <hi>Many are called but few are choſen,</hi>

Surely Danaeus Cont. 4. pag. 689. ſeemeth to deny this, ſaying: <hi>Theſe viſible companies are ſometymes a part of that</hi> (true) <hi>Church, ſometymes none.</hi> But admit that in euery company of true profeſſors there be always a company of iuſt and elect, what reaſon were this, to terme the ſociety in profeſſion of true fayth, the true Church, if in deed the ſociety in iuſtice &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination be the only true Church. This would ſuffice to ſay, that the apparent Church could neuer be ſeparated from the true Church, but not to call that ſociety the true Church, which indeed is only the outward appearance of the true Church. And much leſſe would it ſuffice, to call it the church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo termed, the ſpouſe and body of Chriſt, the Catholike Church, the Church which we profeſſe to belieue; as the Proteſtants haue termed the viſible

Neither can theſe epithets or names be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to any other ſociety, then to that which hath the true nature and ſubſtance of the Church indeed; becauſe they ſignify as properly and expreſly that only Church; as ſhe can be expreſſed of vs by any words whatſoeuer.

Whitaker Cont. 2. queſt. 3. cap. 2. pag. 471. and others. But that church which contayneth the wicked, is the viſible Church, for the inuiſible they will haue to hold only the good. The Scripture therefore teſtifieth that the viſible Church ſhall euer be. Yea Proteſtants now and then take it ſo ill, that it ſhould be ſayd, that they teach that the viſible Church periſhed for many ages, that D. Sutliue in his anſwere to Exceptions cap. 7. ſayth that Bellarmine lyeth in ſaying ſo. And D.

The like ſayth Kemnice in his Common places title of the Church cap. 3. Reineccius in the 4. tome of his Armour cap. 8. and D. Morton in the 1. part of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology lib. 1. cap. 13. But yet that in this matter we neither bely nor ſclaunder them, is manifeſt by what we haue rehearſed in the 4. chapter before going in the 5. number, and thoſe that follow. To which I add, that Caluin in the Preface of his inſtitutions ſetteth the ſtate of this queſtion betwixt vs &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in theſe words: <hi>Vpon this hinge hangeth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy, that they</hi> (Papiſts) <hi>will haue the forme of the church to appeare and be viſible at all tymes: On the contrary we ſay, that the church may conſiſt of no apparent forme.</hi> And I would to God, that Proteſtants would conſtantly agree, which vs in this matter of doctrine, that the church of God is alwayes viſible to ſome, either of thoſe that are in it, or out of it; that the debate might remaine only about the matter of fact,<note place="margin">VVhy Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts contradict the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues about the inuiſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church.</note> whither the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church before Luther appeared, were ſeene of any either Proteſtant or other. But Proteſtants ſtanding betwixt truth and lyes, whiles they conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church of God, eſpecially as it is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in ſcripture, confeſſe that it muſt needs be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not only to her children but to others alſo. But when they look back vpon the ſtate and condition of their owne church before Luther began, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to deny the ſame, as before we moſt euidently
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18174:112"/> ſhewed: which thing alone, if it were well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, would diſcouer ſufficiently, that in their own conſciences they acknowledge their Church not to be the true Church of God.</p>

Fiftly, I proue that the Church cannot be inuiſible, becauſe that were contrary to the ends for which the Church was inſtituted of God: whereof one was, that men ſhould worſhip him after that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier manner of worſhip which man is to giue, which is to honour God not only with heart and mind, but alſo with tongue and deed, as it is euident; and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin in his Confutation of a Hollander, many wayes proueth that the Church muſt render to God, not only inward but alſo outward worſhip. But an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible Church worſhippeth God only in heart and mind, as Whitakers words are. Another end of the Church is to feed her children with the word and Sacraments, to correct and gouerne them by diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and to defend them from enemies; as alſo is manifeſt and ſcripture teacheth. Which offices, a Church, which neither ſeeth her children, nor is ſeene of them, cannot performe. Likewiſe another end is to conuert the world, and thoſe who are out of her, to the fayth and worſhip of God; which ſhe can no way do, if neither her doctrine nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample be ſeene of them. And yet as Luther ſayth vpon the ſixt chapter of Iſaias tom. 4. fol. 234: <hi>The Church is in perpetuall practiſe of conuerting others to the fayth.</hi>

When Bellarmine ſayd, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Synagogue of the Iewes there were in Elias tyme Churches amongſt the Gentils, D. Whitaker Cont. 2. queſt. 3. cap. 3. pag. 475. thus anſwered: <hi>If they ſay that God had other Churches, let them shew them, and tell which they were, and where they were.</hi> And D.

For firſt, if the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church ſhould faile, it is manifeſt that it is not the Church of Chriſt, againſt which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the very gates of hell ſhall not preuaile. And if it be graunted, that the viſible Church is not the Church inſtituted by Chriſt, it muſt needs be but a humane ſociety inſtituted by man. How then ſhold it come to paſſe, that one cannot be ſaued, vnleſſe he be in the viſible Church, if ſo he can be, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Proteſtants do teach? Who contemne all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men as vnneceſſary to ſaluation, why mak they ſuch account of this humane inſtitution? At the laſt the Proteſtants haue felt this miſcheife, as ye may ſee in Caluin in his 3. homily in his Opuſcles pag. 548. and Danaeus in his booke of the viſible church; where they bring many reaſons to proue, that it is neceſſary to be of the viſible church. But ſeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do teach that the viſible church is not the true Church in the ſight of God, and conſequently a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtitution, how can they proue, that God hath commaunded, or men can appoint ſo ſtrictly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this one humane Inſtitution, vnder paine of damnation? Another inconuenience is, that Chriſts promiſes touching the continuance of his church are expoſed to the laughter and mockery of Iewes and Infidels. For ſith (as the Law ſayth, and Proteſtants acknowledge) among men, there is no other account made of things that appeare not, then of things that are not; what man will reaſonably perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that Chriſts Church hath euer continued in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18174:119"/> world, if ſhe for many ages appeared in no one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world? Surely this ſeemeth ſo incredible, that I think not, that any man well in his wittes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth it, howſoeuer for to defend the Proteſtants Church he may ſay it.

The 4. inconuenience is, that if we ſay that the Church may be, and yet not be ſeene of any, we giue occaſion to euery new ſtart vp heretik, to ſay, that his church hath euer byn: neither can we refute this his dotage, vnleſſe we do maintaine that the church muſt be euermore viſible, &amp; profeſſe her faith; which (as we haue ſeene) Proteſtants themſelues do ſuppoſe, when they proue that any Church or company hath not byn in former tymes.</p>

By the foreſayd Confeſſions of Proteſtants it is moſt cleare, that when Luther began to play the Paſtor, there was no Proteſtant preacher at all. For they acknowledge, that they are no Church for any ordinary ſucceſſion; that the true order of the church periſhed, that the true Miniſtery was taken out of the Church, true knowledge of diuine ordination was extinguiſhed, and ordination aboliſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed: That the Church had no true Miniſtery, and that ſhe was deſtitute of true Paſtors. And that they meane theſe words both of a ſubſtantiall &amp; vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall deſtruction of true Miniſtry, is manifeſt both by the ſelfe ſame words and others alſo. For they adde withall, that the ſtate of the church was quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, ordinary vocation wholy corrupted, that ordinary vocation was no where, no place left for ordinary vocation, and there were none, of whome thoſe who freed their Church from Popery, might receiue impoſition of hands: that the ſtate of the Church was ſo interrupted, that God muſt raiſe vp Paſtors extraordinarily, that the true ranck of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was ſo cut of, as that their needed a new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and a new foundation; laſtly that the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical order, the vaine names therof only remayning, was ouerthrowne from the foundation, and lawfull order quit aboliſhed: that there was not left ſo much as the ſlendereſt ſhadow of the cheifeſt parts of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall vocation. In which words either they ſay that there was neuer a Proteſtant Paſtor at all, or that can be ſayd by no words whatſoeuer.

               <p n="2">2.

For Luther Propoſition 15. to. 1. fol. 385. thus defineth a Church: <hi>It is a number of baptized perſons and belieuers vnder one Pastor.</hi> And tom. 2. fol. 366. he ſayth: <hi>The publike Ministery of the word whereby the Myſteries of God are diſpenſed, muſt be inſtituted by holy ordination, as the thing which in the Church is the cheifeſt and principalleſt of all.</hi> Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice in his Common places title of the Church pag. 146: <hi>The Church conſisteth of Paſtors and learners.</hi> Gerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius in his 22.

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:18174:125"/> D. Feild in his 2. booke of the Church cap. 6: <hi>The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Paſtors and teachers is abſolutely and eſſentially neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the being of the Church.</hi> And lib. 1. cap. 10: <hi>Bellarmine laboureth in vaine in prouing that there is and alwayes hath byn a viſible Church, and that not conſiſting of ſome few ſcattered Chriſtians without order of Miniſtry or vſe of Sacraments; for all this we do moſt willingly yield vnto.</hi> Yea the Philoſophers by the light of reaſon perceiued, that <hi>it is impoſsible they should be a Common wealth without Magiſtrates.</hi> This ſame alſo is manifeſt by many other definitions which Proteſtants haue made of the Church, and we haue rehearſed them before, in which they place true preaching and adminiſtration as eſſentiall parts of the true Church; which yet cannot be without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides, this were againſt the definitions of the Church giuen by the holy Fathers. For thus writeth S. Cyprian epiſt. 79: <hi>The Church is the people vnited to the Prieſt, and the flock cleauing to the Paſtor.</hi> And this he proueth out of thoſe words of our Sauiour Math. 16: <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rock will I build my Church.</hi> S. Hierome alſo in his dialogues againſt the Luciferians: <hi>It is no Church which hath no Prieſt.</hi> S. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius in his epiſt. ad Trallianos: <hi>VVithout theſe</hi> (Prieſts) <hi>the elect Church is not, no congregation without theſe, no meeting of Saints.</hi> And whereas Danaeus lib. 4. de Eccl. cap. 8. ſayth, that theſe Fathers define only a viſible church, that auaileth nothing: becauſe indeed there is no Church on earth which is not viſible in profeſſion of faith. Againe, Paſtors ſhall be at leaſt of the eſſence of the viſible Church, and conſequently the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, which before Luther wanted Paſtors, was no viſible Church. Furthermore, S. Cyprian proueth his definition out of thoſe words of Chriſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18174:125"/> Matt. 16. which (as is certaine and Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) are ſpoken of the true Church in the ſight of God. And S. Ignatius ſayth, that there is no elect church, no congregation of Saints, without Prieſts: which he muſt needs meane of the true Church. And Saint Hierome ſimply ſayth it is no Church, which hath no Prieſts: which he could no wayes ſay, if the true Church in the ſight of God could be without Prieſts. And hereby alſo is refuted Sadeel in Repetit. Sophiſm. Turriani pag. 652. when he ſayth: <hi>The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of S. Cyprian is not eſſentiall, nor properly teacheth what the Church is, but what a one it ought to be.</hi> For S. Cyprian inferreth out of his definition, that if one be not with the Biſhop, he is not in the Church. And Saint Hierome pronounceth one Hilaries ſect to haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with him, becauſe he left no Paſtor behind him. And for this cauſe the Fathers do ſtill obiect vnto heretiks the want of ſucceſſion of Paſtors, as an euident marke that they are not the Church; as euen Proteſtants themſelues confeſſe. For thus writeth D. Whitaker Cont. 2. queſt. 5. cap. 6. pag. 509: <hi>The Fathers rebuked heretiks that they wanted ſucceſsion of Bishops.</hi> Sadeel of Vocation of Miniſters pag. 546: <hi>S. Auguſtin oftentyms oppoſed this ſucceſsion against the Manichees and Donatiſts.</hi> Zanchius of the Church pag. 138: <hi>I admit that ſucceſsion of true Bishops is a marke of the Church; and of this ſpeake the Fathers.</hi> The like confeſſe Caluin Reſponſ. ad Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellem pag. 358. and 4.

Neither is it true which D. Whitaker and Sadeel ſay, that the Fathers did not think that they conuinced the Heretiks not to be the Church, becauſe they wanted ſucceſion of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18174:126"/> Paſtors. For S. Irenaeus ſayth that hereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth heretiks, and that this is a moſt full demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. S. Auguſtine writeth, that this argument of ſucceſſion held him in the Church. S. Athanaſius calleth it a notable and admirable argument. And Sadeel himſelfe loc. cit. ſayth that <hi>with this battering ramme S. Cyprian did eſpecially vanquish the Nouatians.</hi> And Peter Martyr in his Common places tit. de Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, writeth that <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Ninthly, I argue, and aske what is the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18174:134"/> meaning of the foreſayd ridle: <hi>The Church was in Popery but Popery was not the Church.</hi> Firſt, I ſuppoſe that by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery heere, they meane not (as did Boyſſeul) popiſh doctrine; as if the ſenſe were, that the Proteſtant Church conſiſted of Popiſh doctrine, as we ſay that the Popiſh Church conſiſteth (to wit formally) of Popiſh doctrine; the Iewiſh Church of Iudaiſme, &amp; the Turkiſh of Turciſme; becauſe this ſenſe were too far from the queſtion, which demaundeth the place, and not the forme, or doctrine of the Proteſtant church in former tyms. Beſides, it were too too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay that the Proteſtant Church conſiſteth in the contrary doctrine, which he condemneth. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing therfore, that hereby Popery they vnderſtand the company of Papiſts, their meaning cannot be, that their Church was in the company of Papiſts, as in a multitude of men amongſt whom they liued on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but did no way participate of their doctrine or worſhip; both becauſe in this manner, it had byn knowne to Papiſts, which notwithſtanding they deny, as before we ſhewed, and anone ſhalbe proued to be falſe; as alſo becauſe in this ſort their Church may be ſayd to be in Iudaiſme, Turciſme, &amp; the like, if they liue among Iewes or Turcks; which is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deny their meaning to be ſuch. For thus Beza epiſt. 10. queſt. 4: <hi>The Church was in Popery, which can no way be ſayd of the Turks.</hi> And M. Perkins lib. cit. after he ſayd that the Church was long tyme in Popery, addeth, <hi>VVhich cannot be likewiſe ſayd of Turks and other Infidels, that the Church was conſerued, or that yet any hidden Church is conſerued among them.</hi> Neither can their meaning be, that the Proteſtant church was in tymes paſt in Popery, as a part in the whole, to wit, becauſe it conſiſted of ſome that belieued both Proteſtancy
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18174:134"/> and Popery, or if they did not belieue Popery, yet they profeſſed it; becauſe after this manner Popery ſhould no leſſe haue byn the Church, the Church ſhould haue byn in Popery. For as the church ſhould haue byn in Popery, becauſe it conſiſted of ſuch a part of Popery; ſo Popery ſhold haue byn the church becauſe ſuch a part of Popery had byn the Church. Beſides, it implieth contradiction, that one ſhould belieue both Popery and Proteſtancy, which as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſay, are right oppoſite in many fundamental points. If any reply, that thoſe Papiſts in whom the Proteſtant Church of old tyme did conſiſt, did not belieue all fundamentall points of Popery, nor were abſolutely Papiſts, but only in part and in ſome ſort: firſt he mocketh the Reader in ſaying abſolutely, that the Proteſtant church was in Popery, becauſe Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſolutely taken, doth ſignify abſolute Papiſts or Papiſtry. Beſides he feigneth and deuiſeth thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in part &amp; in ſome ſort, and cannot proue by any ſufficient teſtimony that there were any ſuch; Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as according to S.

               <p n="8">8.

Proteſtants, like men vncertaine anſwere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly to this queſtion. D. Whitaker Cont. 2. queſt. 3. cap. 3. pag. 474. ſayth: <hi>Our Churches were alwayes in the middest of Papists churches, diſtinct from Papiſts in Communion and Profeſſion.</hi> But this is ſoone refuted.

                  <hi>And to caſt out words and proue naught, what is it</hi> (as S.

For as D.

Beſides otherwiſe Catholiks would not haue ſo earneſtly enquired of Proteſtants, where their Church had byn heretofore. Moreouer Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes had perſecuted them as they perſecuted Luther, ſo ſoone as he was knowne for a Proteſtant. Laſtly, becauſe Proteſtants cannot name any Papiſts, who knew of their Church before Luthers tyme. Others therefore ſay, that thoſe imaginary Proteſtants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their fayth, if not at other tymes, yet at leaſt at the point of death. D.

Againe, if only at the houre of death they profeſſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, they were Proteſtants no longer then they lay a dying; and conſequently the Proteſtant church endured no longer then ſome of her children were dying. A ſtrange Church certes, that liued no longer then her children dyed; nor at any tyme drew breath, but whiles they gaue vp the ghoſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they find out other deuiſes to ſay, that thoſe fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned Proteſtants communicated with Papiſts and profeſſed their fayth in things lawfull, as in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, reading of the Scriptur, and ſuch like; but not in things vnlawfull. Thus Reineccius in the 4. tome of his armour cap. 4.

Wherein he ſpeakes more truly then he meant. For the true Church is and was alwayes in the Romane; but the Proteſtant, neither is, nor was there. To the argument I anſwere, that this place can be no ſufficient ground of fayth among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtans, becauſe their Angel, their Apoſtle, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt Martyn Luther, denyeth the Apocalipſe to be Canonicall Scripture.

Yea as any may with greateſt probability shew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies there to be fulfilled, ſo is it free for any to vſe his iudgement &amp; to follow his own opinion in explicating them.</hi> And D.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18174:142"/> But, as Luther in cap. 9. Geneſ. tom. 6. fol. 114. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Anabaptiſts and others:<note place="margin">VVhy Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to much of the Apoc.</note>

               <p n="2">2. Thirdly I anſwere, that the foreſayd place is allegoricall, myſticall, and obſcure, and therefore not fit to ground fayth vpon. That it is myſticall and allegoricall, is manifeſt, becauſe Babylon doth not litterally, but at moſt myſtically ſignify Popery. That alſo the ſenſe which Proteſtants frame thereof is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, is euident, becauſe they cannot either by any part or by any circumſtance therof, clearly ſhew, that by Babylon is meant Popery. Beſides, neither any of the Fathers, nor of thoſe imaginary Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther, did perceiue this ſenſe; otherwiſe ſome of them would haue obeyed Gods commandement, and gone out of Popery.

                  <hi>Our aduerſaries ſerue themſelues of the ſame weapons, whereof moſt wicked heretikes did; and herein shew themſelues to be nothing leſſe then Catholikes.</hi> Moreouer I ſay, that if I liſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scriptures at my pleaſure, I might ſay, and more probably too then Proteſtants, that by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd words God commandeth Proteſtants to goe out of Proteſtancy. For Proteſtancy may well be called Babylon, becauſe it is a Maſſe and confuſion of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite hereſies, where almoſt euery one hath a fayth of his owne, and ſpeaketh a peculiar language, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the tongue or doctrine of another. And Proteſtants may be called the people of God in that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18174:143"/> they are baptiſed, and therein dedicated to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; and pretend the fayth of Chriſt as did Iſrael euen after it had foreſaken the Synagogue:<note place="margin">De prouid. art. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> And as Caluin ſayth that God calleth euen the diſobedient, his ſeruants, as Nabuchodonozor in Hieremy, and as God hath both good and faythfull ſeruants, and naughty and vnfaythfull; ſo hath he good &amp; naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly I anſwere, that the argument which can be framed out of this place, to proue that which the Proteſtants write of their churches being in Popery before Luther aroſe, to wit: <hi>Goe you my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Babylon. Therefore before Luthers tyme the church was in Popery, and ſo ſecret as for many ages she was not ſeene either of her own or of others;</hi> is a meere Sophiſme. Firſt becauſe one vnknown thing is here proued by another more vnknown, a falſe thing by another not only falſe, but alſo impoſſible. For more vnknowne it is, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, more impoſſible that the Proteſtant church ſhould be the people of God, or that Babylon, out of which Gods people is bidden to goe, Popery: then that Proteſtants haue byn heretofore amongſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. For this, although it be both falſe and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, yet it is not impoſſible, as the other is. How then can they proue vnto vs, that they were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Popery, by affirming that they are that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and Popery that Babylon, ſith this is to vs farre more incredible, then the other. Let Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn ſometyme in Scripture myſtically ſignify the citty of Rome; let it alſo ſignify the number of the wicked both faythfull and Infidels; but in Scripture it neuer ſignifieth a certaine religion, and leaſt of all Popery. Beſides his Maieſty in his Epiſtle to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Peron, hath thoſe words: <hi>VVhat that Babylon is, out
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18174:144"/> of which Gods people is commanded to go, the King enquireth not in this place, nor pronounceth any thing of that matter.</hi> And if his Maieſty will not pronounce what that Babylon is, why ſhould Miniſters do it? Secondly, it is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſme, becauſe there are many things in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, which are not at all in the antecedent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be vnderſtood as Proteſtants would. And therefore herein they not only proue an vnknowne thing by another more vnknowne; but ſome things they proue only by themſelues, that is, they affirme them, and proue them not at all. For let the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants be the people of God; and let Popery be that Babylon (which they can neuer proue) neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that the Proteſtant Church had byn in Popery ſo long tyme, to wit, ſo many ages, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to wit ſo ſecret as ſhe was altogeather inuiſible either to her own or to others, can no way be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the foreſayd words, though they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the Proteſtants mind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their ſecond argument they ground vpon that, 2. Theſſal. 2. that Antichriſt ſhall ſit in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, which they expound, as that the Pope ſhould ſit in the true, that is, according to them, the Proteſtant Church, and conſequently that heretofor the Pope ruled ouer Proteſtants. To which I anſwer, that this argument is a Sophiſme like to the former. Firſt, becauſe it proueth an vnknown thing by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more vnknowne; and one vntruth, by another both vntrue and impoſſible. For it is more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs, that Proteſtants are the temple of God, or the Pope Antichriſt, then that they were heretofore amongſt Papiſts. Secondly if hence they Inferre, that their Church was ſo long in Popery, and in ſuch manner as we haue recited out of their words, they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18174:144"/> will inferre that in the conſequent, whereof there is no ſigne in the Antecedent, although it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to their deſire. Thirdly I ſay, that there can be no certainty gathered out of this place, becauſe it is obſcure, as appeareth both by it ſelfe, and by the different expoſitions thereof,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>20.</hi> de Ciuit. c. <hi>29.</hi>
                  </note> and by the iudgement of S. Auguſtine, who writeth thus: <hi>In what temple of God Antichriſt is to ſit as God, it is vncertaine, whether in that ruine of the temple which Salomon built, or in the Church.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>I truly profeſſe my ſelfe not to know, what he ſayd; yet I will relate the ſuſpicions of men, which I haue heard or read of this matter.</hi> And againe: <hi>One in this ſort, another in that, gheſſeth at the obſcure words of the Apoſtle.</hi> Yea D.

                  </note> that it cannot be certainly gathered hence, that the Pope is Antichriſt, when he ſayth: <hi>It is probably gathered out of the</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſal. That the Bishop of Rome is Antichriſt.</hi> But we regard not, whence they probably gather what they pleaſe, but only whence they can certainly &amp; vndoubtedly proue what they ſay. Fourthly I ſay, that whatſoeuer is the temple of God wherein Antichriſt ſhall ſit, this place it ſelfe ſheweth, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, becauſe he ſitteth not in the Church of God as God, but as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and as Gods vicar. Fithly I adde, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelues do not firmly belieue,<note place="margin">Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> much leſſe as a point of their fayth, that the Pope is Antichriſt, howſoeuer they vſe the name of Antichriſt as a bugg to feare children. For Melancthon, as Schuffelburg reporteth, <hi>ſeemed to doubt whether the Pope were Antichriſt, or no.</hi> D. Whitaker lib. 1. cont. Dureum ſect. 33: ſayth: <hi>In the meane tyme,</hi>

                  <hi>we muſt needs probably and iuſtly ſuſpect the Pope to be Antichriſt</hi> And Cont. 4. queſt. 5. cap. 3: <hi>Many who care not much for the Pope, do not think, that it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he is Antichriſt.</hi> And his Maieſty in his Monitory

How then can they certainly gather out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd place, that the Pope ſat among Proteſtants? Yea ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deny the Pope to be the true Antichriſt. For thus Luther in cap. 9. Geneſ. tom. 6. fol. 122: <hi>VVe hold the Turck for the true Antichriſt.</hi> Zanchius lib. 1. Epiſt. ad Stuckium: <hi>I am perſwaded that the name of Antichriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth rather to the Turck then to Pope.</hi> And in his anſwere to an Arian, Antitheſ. 21. col. 879: <hi>The Bishop of Rome is not that Antichriſt whereof is meant</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. And in his Diſceptation betwixt two Deuines pag. 637. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſ. ad calumnias pag. 217. he plainly denyeth, that the Pope <hi>is that notable and ſingular Antichriſt, wherof the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeake.</hi> And his opinion herein many Proteſtant vniuerſities do iudge probable, namely the vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Marſpurg, Heidelberg, Zurich, &amp; Baſle, among which, that of Zurich hath theſe words: <hi>The</hi> 2. <hi>Theſis of Antichriſt, cannot be reiected as hereticall, ſeeing it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For almoſt all the Fathers are of that mind.</hi> Againe: <hi>Since malice daily increaſeth, nothing letteth but at the laſt ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one may come who in impiety ſurpaſſeth all the enemies of the Ghoſpell.</hi> Vorſtius alſo in his Antibellarm. pag. 79: <hi>VVho diſcourſe more aduiſedly of this matter, do graunt that it is very likely, that yet ſome one shall ariſe, to whom all the qualites of Antichriſt may agree in the highest degree.</hi> What certainty then can Proteſtants haue out of the foreſayd place,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18174:145"/> for their purpoſe, ſith ſome of their beſt learned doe but doubt, and others deny, that the Pope is that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, wherof S. Paul ſpeaketh?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The third argument they wring out of the 12. Apocal. where it is ſayd, that the dragon ſhall cauſe the woman, that is, the Church, to fly into the wilderneſſe. This alſo is a fallacy, not vnlike to the former. Firſt, becauſe it is more vnknowne that the Proteſtant church is the woman, or the true church, or the Pope that Dragon, or the Popery the deſert, he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Proteſtants were heretofor amongſt Papiſts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine there is no ſpeach at all, that the Church ſhold be ſo long tyme and ſo ſecret as Proteſtants ſay their church was in Popery. Yea the tyme which this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was to abide in the wilderneſſe, is ſet downe, to be 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> or (as it is ſayd cap. 20.) a ſmall tyme. And as Luther vpon Daniel tom. 4. fol 265. and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger conc. 46. in Apocal. write: <hi>Almoſt all Doctours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute but</hi> 3. <hi>yeares and halfe to the perſecution of Antichriſt.</hi> Wherefore theſe kind of teſtimonies, by which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants make ſhew to proue that their Church was heretofore in Popery, are but as S.

But here by the Reader ſeeth how needfull it is for me to heap vp many teſtimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ies of Proteſtants, for to proue euen thoſe things which are moſt manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               </head>
               <p>THE ſeauenth demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to proue Luther to be the firſt Beginner of Proteſtancy, ſhall be taken from thence, that after that Luther ſecurely preached Proteſtancy, no Proteſtant ancienter thou he peeped out, and adioyned himſelfe vnto him. This I proue: firſt out of the reall Confeſſion of all Proteſtants, who neither then, nor hitherto could name one ſuch Proteſtant. Whereupon it followeth neceſſarily, that Luthers company was altogether
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18174:152"/> new, &amp; no one member thereof before him; neither did he adioyne thoſe whome de drew out of Popery vnto any company before extant; neither did any company which had bin before, adioyne it ſelfe vnto him. Secondly this may be proued by the ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of D. Whitaker Cont. 2. queſt. 5. cap. 3. where being vrged with this argument, he anſweareth it with ſilence only, and ſtandeth mute, as confeſſing the accuſation to be true. Thirdly I proue it by the ſillineſſe of the Anſweares of other. Iunius lib. 4. de Eccleſ. cap. 5. ſayth only, that ſome ancienter Proteſtants came forth, and adioyned themſelues to Luther, but nameth none, nor proueth any thing; &amp; therfore giueth words &amp; nought elſe. He ſhould, as Tertullian ſaid to old heretikes, <hi>haue feignes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of ſome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Praeſcrip. c. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>For after blaſphemy what may not they doe?</hi> But I know not how it cometh to paſſe, that wheras Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants feigne many things and perſons, yet they dare not feigne names. As D. Sutliue, when in the Preface of his book of the Church he had ſayd only, that Bolſec (who wrote Caluins life) doth inſinuate that he wrote for hire; after growing more bould in his anſweare to exceptions cap. 4. pag 120 deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſynode,<note place="margin">D.

                  </note> perhaps by D. Sutliue, but yet durſt not feigne the names either of the men who held this ſynode, or of the place where it was held, nor yet ſpecifie the yeare of our Lord when it was held. This he left to others to feigne, or to himſelfe at more leaſure</p>
               <p n="2">2. Fourthly it may be proued by the ridiculous nomination and prouing made by ſome. D. Morton
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18174:152"/> part. Apol. lib. 1. cap. 16. writeth that Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon, Pellican, Lambert, Capito, Oſiander, Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Bucer came forth, which he proueth becauſe Alphonſe a Caſtro in the epiſtle dedicatory of his booke againſt hereſies hath theſe words; <hi>Neither did Luther in this age come forth alone, but accompanyed with a great troupe as with a guard,</hi> and nameth thoſe before cited. But firſt it is ridiculous to ſay, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd perſons were Proteſtants before Luther, ſith partly themſelues, partly Proteſtants deny it, as we ſhewed in the former chapter. Againe, it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to proue this by Caſtroes teſtimony, who being a Spaniard, and thoſe all Germans except Lambert who was a French ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is moſt likely that he neuer knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor heard of their names before Luther had reuolted. Moreouer ridiculous it is, to imagin that in the forecited words Caſtro ſhould ſay, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named perſons did come forth in ſuch ſort as we mean, that is, came out of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lurking holes, or to haue bin ſecret Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts before Luther appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſeeing he only ſaith, that they came forth in ſuch ſort as he ſaith Luther came forth, to wit forth of the Catholik church &amp; of Catholiks became heretiks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fiftly I proue it out of the common doctrine of Proteſtants, wherin they teach that euery one ought to adioyne himſelfe to the viſible Church if ſo he can conueniently. For ſo teacheth the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the low countryes art. 28. the French art. 26. Melancthon in cap. 8. Matth. Caluin 4. Inſtitut. cap. 1. D whitaker Cont. 2. queſt. 3 cap. 2 and others commonly. But theſe former Proteſtants (if any ſuch had bin) might conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly haue ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to Luthers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany after that they ſaw him to preach ſecurely and out of danger. Seeing therfore,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18174:153"/> no ſuch came to him, it is manifeſt that there were no ſuch at all. Finally this is manifeſt otherwiſe. For ſuppoſe, that before Luther they lay ſo cloſe, as that they worſhipped God only in hart and ſoule, yet when they ſaw Proteſtancy to be preached pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely and ſecurely, and that they might liue openly and amongſt men, who will imagine, that they would preferre darcknes before light, and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king holes before townes and citties, and alwayes keep in deſerts? Certaidly ſuch kind of fellowes ſhould be rather batts or owles, then men. Beſides being iuſt men, forſooth, why did they not afford God externall worſhip whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might ſecurely doe it? Why did they not according to Chriſts comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement celebrate the memory of his Paſſion by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacraments?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Out of theſe I compoſe the ſeauenth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: <hi>If after that Luther ſecurely preached Proteſtancy, neuer any ancienter Proteſtant came forth and adioyned himſelfe to his company, there were no Proteſtants before. But no ſuch euer came forth. Ergo.</hi> But if there were no Proteſtant before Luther, vndoubtedly he was the beginner of that company.</p>

               <p>THE eighth demonſtration with which we will proue, that Luther was the beginner of the Proteſtant Church and religion, we will frame out of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Confeſſions of the nouelty therof: Firſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18174:153"/> therfore they ſay, that in the iudgment almoſt of all men it is new, and that it is almoſt impoſſible,<note place="margin">Now in almoſt all mens iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement.</note> to wipe away from it the ſpot of noueltie. Thus Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus in the Preface of his Catalogue: <hi>VVhen Doctours rayſed of God preach the</hi> (Proteſtant) <hi>goſpell and doe inueigh againſt contrary errors, they ſeeme in the iudgement almoſt of all men to bring a new doctrine vnheard of before and to impugne the old.</hi> Againe: <hi>It is very hard and almost impoſſible to remoue the hatefull marck of nouelty from the</hi> (Proteſtant) <hi>doctrine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> To which D. Fulke lib. de Succeſſ. pag. 454. addeth, that the Proteſtant religion, <hi>VVas altogether new to moſt nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly in equiualent words they oftentymes call their Religion new or begun of new. For as we ſhal ſtraight rehearſe they terme it <hi>in the blade, renaſcent, reuiuing, borne a new, renewed, repayred, reſtored, rayſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, reſuſcitated.</hi> And what can be meant by theſe termes, but a religion either new or newly erecteth, ſuch as Chriſts religion is not?

Fiftly I proue the nouelty of Proteſtant reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion becauſe euen then when in words they deny it to be new, in very deed they confeſſe it to be new in ſuch ſort as ſufficeth for me to proue that Luther was the Author therof, and that it is not the religion of Chriſt, to wit, that it is of new erected, built &amp; ſet vp according to the very ſubſtance and eſſence therof in ſuch ſorr as a houſe falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe but newly raiſed in walls, roofe and other ſuch ſubſtantiall, parts may be called a new houſe; Becauſe Chriſts Church and religion cannot be new in this ſort, being ſuch as can neuer fall. For they confeſſe, that the antiquity of their Church was abrogated, and that it is a religion refined and reformed, and that they are refiners and reformers. D. Morton 1. part. Apol. lib 1. cap vlt writeth that Proteſtants <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

For the kingdome in Caeſars time was new in Rome although it began with the citty it ſelfe, becauſe it had bin abrogated for diuers ages. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Riuet Epitom-Cont. tract. 3 cap. 21 ſayth: <hi>Things are called new, when they are renewed and vſed after interruption.</hi> Beſides whether a thing once abrogated and taken away and afterward reſtored be to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led new or no, it ſufficeth to me, that the Proteſtant religion is in ſuch ſort new, as a houſe fallen downe and newly raiſed may be called n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w: becauſe the Church &amp; religion of Chriſt cannot be new in this manner, nor the antiquity therof, abrogated, and cut of. In like ſort Muſcle in locis tit. de noua doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trina pag. 417: Albeit he deny that they make new doctrine yet he confeſſeth that they renew doctrine, And that he meaneth of a ſubſtantiall renouation wherin the very ſubſtance of a thing is renewed, it appeareth by the precedent page where he ſayth that <hi>old matters abrogated &amp; fallen down for ſome ages are renewed.</hi> A Church therfore and religion fallen downe they doe renew, that is, erect a new. Wherupon the French Confeſſion, Beza, &amp; Baſtingius as is before recited ſay that their Church <hi>is againe, &amp; a new erected,</hi> and others cal her a Church <hi>Reuiued, reſuſcitated, reborn</hi> and aſſigne a new birth and begining of her, which words doe manifeſtly ſignifie a new ſubſtantial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or making of her: which whether it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a nouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or renouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, maketh not much to the purpoſe, ſeing it is either a ſubſtantial production or firſt making of that which neuer had bin before, or
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18174:159"/> a reproduction and ſecond making of that, which though it had bin before, yet was fallen, and the ſubſtance therof corrupted and periſhed. Of which nouation or renouation Luther was the Author, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they call themſelues <hi>Renewers or Refiners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.</note> and their Church or religion <hi>Reformed or refined.</hi> D. Andrewes Reſponſ. ad Apol. Bellarm. cap. 1: <hi>VVe are Renewers.

I aske therfore what kind of forme of religion haue they taken away by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and what a one haue they giuen? Surely they haue changed the very ſubſtantiall forme. For (to omit al other points) they haue taken away the former manner of obtayning remiſſion of ſinnes by the Catholike faith and good workes, and brought in a new of obtayning the ſame by ſpecial faith only, and vndoubtedly the way to obtaine remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins, is ſubſtantiall to a Church and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they who take away the ſubſtantiall forme and bring anew, doe make a new thing, and ſuch a mutation ought rather to be termed a formation, then reformation. But whether it be called a formation or reformation, it skilleth little, it ſufficeth (as I ſayd) that it is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall mutation of religion the Author whereof Luther was, and ſuch a mutation, as cannot happen to the religion and Church of Chriſt. Moreouer, it is the ſhift of old and new heretiques to bring in new religions vnder the name of Reformation. Of the Marcioniſts thus writeth Tertullian: <hi>They ſay that

This name our aduerſaries haue faſtened vpon vs, only vpon malice and enuie: Neither are we called Lutherans but of the Papiſts.</hi> Falſe alſo is that, which D. Fulke ſayth de Succeſſ. pag. 188. that <hi>they acknowledge no other name proper to their religion, but the name of Christians and Catholiques.</hi> Theſe I ſay are falſe; for Luther (whome D. Whitaker accounteth his father) and the Lutherans (whome he termeth his brethren in Chriſt) doe call themſelues ſo, and are
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18174:170"/> well pleaſed with that name. Beſides, they are ſo termed of the Sacramentaries and common people, and therfore not of Papiſts only, nor vpon malice and enuie, but (as Grauer ſayd) truly for diſtinction ſake, and that moſt iuſtly. For as S. Athanaſe ſayth, <hi>VVho deriue the origen of their ſaith from other then Christ, iuſtly carry the ſurnames of their Authors.</hi> But Proteſtants (as we haue ſhewed) confeſſe that they deriue the origen of their faith from Luther. Therfore iuſtly they beare his name.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Out of all which hath bin rehearſed in this chapter, I thus frame my ninth demonſtration of this Matter: <hi>If Luther and many other famous Proteſtants ſometimes indeed, ſome times in plaine words do confeſſe, that Luther was the Author of their Church and religion, he ought to be ſo taken and eſteemed. But they do ſoe confeſſe. Ergo.</hi> The Minor is euident by all that is ſayd in this Chapter: And the Maior, by what we ſayd in the Preface. For ſo many and ſuch principall Proteſtants knew well the origen of their religion, and willingly would not lye to the diſgrace and ouerthrow therof.</p>

For all their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments herein be reduced to this one: <hi>Our doctrine is the doctrine of Chriſt: Therfore our Church was alwayes ſince Chriſt.</hi> For thus agreeth D.

The Proteſtant Church holdeth the true doctrin, holdeth the true doctrin of Chriſt as</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we will proue by ſcripture. Therefore it hath bin alway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I anſwere that this argument is a manifeſt ſophime for many cauſes.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18174:172"/> a concluſion out of particuler propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But if the Maior be vniuerſall, according as it is made of D. Whitaker, then ſo farre is it from being out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy (as he affirmeth) that it is manifeſtly falſe, and no way true, but only apparant, and therefore vnfit to make a true ſyllogiſme, but only a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait and a ſophiſme.<note place="margin">Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts aſſume a manifeſt falſity.</note> That it is manifeſtly falſe, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe that Church or company of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which is ſtrictly and properly termed ſchiſmatical, holdeth the true doctrine of Chriſt as both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teach, and the Proteſtants themſelues doe alſo moſt plainely affirme, &amp; yet it is not the true church of Chriſt. Wherefore ſith (as the Philoſopher tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) thoſe thinges are probable, which ſeem true to all, or to moſt, or to wiſe men, and thoſe either al or moſt, or moſt approued, and ſuch as are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſerue only to make ſophiſmes; The foreſayd Maior, not ſeeming true to all, or moſt, or the wiſeſt Chriſtians, yea not euen to the Proteſtants themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, it is manifeſt, that it is no probable propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only apparent, and therefore not fit to make a true ſyllogiſme, but only an apparent and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Fathers teach that a Schiſmatical Church holdeth the true doctrine of Chriſt, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by S. Auguſtine who lib. queſt.

What reaſon then haue they, out of the trueneſſe of the doctrin of their Churches to inferre their perpetuall exiſtence?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thirdly I adde, that the manner wherwith Proteſtants doe proue the Minor of their foreſayd ſyllogiſme, is ſophiſticall and not ſuch as they exact of vs for proofe of our doctrine. For commonly they exact of vs to ſhew, that our doctrine is contained in expreſſe words in Scripture, or (as Luther ſayth lib. de ſeru. arbit. tom. 2. fol. 440) <hi>inſo manifeſt teſtimonies as are able ſo to stop all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouths as they are not able to ſay any thing againſt it.</hi> But manifeſt it is, that ſuch be not the proofes wher with Proteſtants proue their doctrine.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18174:176"/> For to omit other points, where is in expreſſe words in ſcripture that fundamentall point of their doctrin that we are iuſtified by only faith? Say the contrary is ſo expreſly in S. Iames epiſtle,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>6.</hi> in c. <hi>12.</hi> Gen.</note> as therfore Luther blaſphemouſly ſayth <hi>S.

                  </note> Proteſtants doe now confeſſe, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not of it ſelfe ſufficient to end all queſtions of faith, and that Schiſmatikes cannot be conuinced by ſcripture. How then can they ſufficiently proue al the points of their doctrine by ſcripture?<note place="margin">VVhitak. loc. cit. p. <hi>490.</hi> Pleſſy l. de Eccleſ. c. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> Againe, themſelues acknowledge, that they need certaine meanes to attaine to the right ſenſe of the Scripture and that their meanes are humane and not infallible, as knowledge of tongues, conference of places, and ſuch like, and with all, that ſuch as the meanes be, ſuch is the expoſition of Scripture. If therfore their meanes be not infallible, how can their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſcripture be infallible? Moreouer, they ſcarce euer proue any thing by both principles out of ſcripture, but almoſt euermore adioyne one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man principles, as eaſily will appeare if their proofs be brought to a ſyllogiſticall forme, as well obſerue the moſt learned Biſhop of Luçon in his defence of the Principall articles of faith cap. 3. &amp; 5. And how can they be infallibly certaine of the concluſion, which they cannot know but by one human princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereof they can haue no ſuch certainty? Furthermore, becauſe many of their proofes doe not only conſiſt of one humane principle,<note place="margin">Proteſtats conclude againſt ſenſe.</note> which is not at al in the ſcripture, but alſo they inferre a concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> directly contradictory to that which the ſcripture in moſt expreſſe words teacheth of that matter. As for example, when they proue that the Euchariſt is of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18174:176"/> not the very body and bloud of Chriſt, alwayes one of their principles is humane; and beſides their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is flat contrary to expreſſe words of ſcripture, which affirmeth that it is Chriſts very body and bloud. And who is he in his wittes, that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe, either that the ſcripture meaneth, that the Euchariſt is not the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, which directly it neuer ſayth, rather, then that it is his body and bloud, which it as expreſly ſayth, as euer it ſayth any thing, or that that proofe is not ſophiſticall, which out of one humane principle at leaſt, inferreth the contrary of that, which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moſt expreſly teacheth? Laſtly, they neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any one point of their doctrine any otherwiſe, then euer Heretiks do, that is in their own iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neuer before any iudge or general Councell, which Luther himſelfe confeſſeth in c. 27. Gen. tom 6. fol. 368. in the words: <hi>In the affaire of the Goſpell we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the matter againſt al the impiety of the Pope without form of law. VVe accuſed not the Pope, neither could we, for there was no iudge.</hi> Yea their doctrin hath bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all forme of law in the Generall Councel of Trent &amp; of the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they appealed, and of al other kinds of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Fourthly I ſay, that the foreſayd argument is a ſophiſme, in that in a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible matter (as the Church is) it concludeth againſt the ſenſe of all men. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any ſee the Proteſtant Church before Luther, neither did any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feele or perceiue himſelfe to haue bin a member of ſuch a Church before that time. Wherfore, as he ſhould manifeſtly play the Sophiſter who would goe about to proue by ſcripture that the ſunne appeareth at midnight: ſo likewiſe doth he, who out of ſcripture endeuoreth to proue, that there
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18174:177"/> was a proteſtant Church before Luther, becauſe all mens ſenſe conuince the one as well as the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Proteſtants write, that though faith commaund vs to beleiue things which we ſee not, yet it doth not commaund vs, not to beleiue that which we ſee, for otherwiſe faith ſhould be contrary to ſenſe, and none ſhould become faithfull, but he ſhould firſt be ſenſeleſſe. But ſurely wonderfull is the blindnes or wilfulneſſe of Sacramentaries, who in the matter of the Euchariſt, againſt the moſt expreſſe words of Scripture, will endeuour to proue by ſenſe, that there is not the body of Chriſt, when as the body of Chriſt there is not ſenſible. And here in the matter of exiſtence of their Church before Luther, out of ſome apparent ſhew of ſcripture, againſt the moſt manifeſt ſenſe of all men, will proue, that it was before Luthers time. When as a Church is a ſenſible thing, and can be felt either of others, or at leaſt of them who are of it. How much better and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſhould they proceed, if in the Euchariſt where Chriſts body is not ſenſible, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue eare to the moſt expreſſe words of ſcripture then to the ſuſpicions of their ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes, which can iudge of nothing but of ſenſible accidents; and in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church, whoſe being is ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible, they would ſubmit their vncertaine (if not falſe) expoſitions of ſcripture, not only to the ſenſe of all men, but alſo the moſt certaine expoſitions of the Church and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But this ſheweth, that in their beleife they are guided neither by ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe nor ſcripture but out of them both borrow a ſhew of proofe for that which of their mere wilfulnes or fancy they chooſe to beleiue.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thus thou ſeeſt (Chriſtian Reader) for how vaine a ſophiſme, whoſe Maior is manifeſtly falſe &amp;

Therfore &amp;c.</hi> And if it were not before Luther, ſurely he is the Author of it. The Maior is euident by it ſelfe, and the Minor by what hath bin brought in this chapter. Certainely if euery one of the demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrations which we haue brought, doe not conuince that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church and religion was not before Luther, at leaſt all of them together manifeſtly conuince it. For by the firſt fiue demonſtrations was ſhewed that before Luther it was not at all, it was in no place,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18174:178"/> was vnknowne of all the world, was not ſeene of any, nor had any Paſtors: And with the reſt hath bin demonſtrated, that after Luther aroſe no anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter Proteſtant did euer appeare and adioyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Luther, that all the firſt knowne Proteſtant had bin Papiſts afore times, that the Proteſtant company and religion is new, that Luther and other plainly confeſſe, that he was autho of that religion, and finally that no proofe beſides one friuolous fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie can be brought to ſhew, that ſuch a Church or religion had bin in former times. And if yet any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doubt hereof, let him at leaſt compare al the foreſayd demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrations, wherwith ſo many wayes out of the very teſtimonies of Proteſtants we haue ſhewed, that no ſuch Church was before Luther, with their vaine ſophiſme, wherewith they make ſhew to proue the contrary, and he will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue on whoſe ſide this ſo important truth is like to ſtand. And if he make any account of truth, of Gods ſeruice, of his owne reputation, or eternall ſaluation he will forſake the Proteſtants Church, &amp; put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the lappe of the Catholike Church.
